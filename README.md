# Text-Trivia
The code for Text Trivia submitted to the We Can Jam 2020 hackathon. Text Trivia is a SMS based trivia game where players receive 
multiple choice questions via text. The game is in real time so everyone signed up receives questions at the same time approximately. The last person standing
after 5 questions is the winner! The code allows for the admin to create a game using the gameStarter page and to change the questions if they have the questions.txt file. 
We hope to expand the game later on by adding web based features on top of SMS (make question delivery not dependent on text messages).
